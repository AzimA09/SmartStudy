# Study Smart – Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Plan

This document outlines the **MVP scope**, **2-week sprint structure**, **team allocations**, and **testing/validation** approach for the Study Smart project.

---

## MVP Goals
Deliver a functional app prototype that includes:
1. Smart Schedule Integration  
2. User Profile Creation  
3. Assignment & Priority Management  
4. Task Creation & Reminders  
5. Dashboard Overview  

Each of these features connects directly to user stories defined in [`USER_STORIES.md`](USER_STORIES.md).

## Sprint Structure

| Sprint | Duration | Focus | Expected Output |
|---------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Sprint 1** | Weeks 1–2 | Core data structures and schedule input | Functional schedule page + backend structure |
| **Sprint 2** | Weeks 3–4 | Profile/login implementation + dashboard UI | Working login system & interactive dashboard |
| **Sprint 3** | Weeks 5–6 | Task reminders + testing | Notification system + MVP integration test |

Each sprint concludes with a **review/demo** and **backlog refinement**.

---

## Task Allocation

| Team Member | Responsibility |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Nya** | Task & reminder module, notification logic |
| **Maija** | Schedule integration, time conflict handling |
| **Samantha** | Dashboard design, daily summary display |
| **Azim** | Profile/login system, user data storage integration |

All members collaborate on sprint planning, testing, and documentation.

---

## Development Approach
- Follow **Agile SCRUM** framework with **2-week sprints**.  
- Use **GitHub Projects** to track tasks and progress (Kanban view).  
- Conduct **daily stand-ups** (asynchronously if needed).  
- Complete sprint reviews and retrospectives after each iteration.

---

## Testing & Validation
| Testing Type | Description | Responsible |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Unit Testing** | Each component tested individually for correctness | Assigned developer |
| **Integration Testing** | Combine modules (schedule + profile + reminders) | Student 2 & Student 4 |
| **Usability Testing** | Evaluate clarity and ease of use among peers | All members |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Features meet user stories defined in requirements | Team review |

---

## Tools & Tracking
- **GitHub Projects:** task management and sprint boards  
- **Git Issues:** individual feature sub-tasks  
- **Google Docs / Discord:** team communication  
- **Testing Tools:** Manual tests + mock data inputs  

---

## MVP Success Criteria
- Users can create profiles and log in securely  
- Users can add class/work schedules  
- System generates adaptive study plan  
- Users receive reminders and can prioritize assignments  
- Dashboard provides a clear daily overview
