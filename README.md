# SmartStudy
> An intelligent planner app for students who want smarter time management.

---

**StudySmart** is an interactive mobile planner designed to help students organize their academic and personal schedules more efficiently.  
Unlike standard planners that simply record events, StudySmart analyzes user inputs such as: classes, work hours, and assignments to **automatically generate adaptive study plans and reminders** that fit each user’s real-life routine.

## Rationale
We created Study Smart because many students struggle to balance school, work, and life.  
Most planner apps require manual input and don’t adapt to changes, making time management stressful.

**StudySmart** provides:
* Personalized, auto-generated study plans.
* Schedule conflict prevention and smart updates.
* Secure user profiles that save progress across devices.
* Task and priority management all in one place.
