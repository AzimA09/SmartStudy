### Story 1 – Adding Class & Work Schedules
**Before:**
There is no option to add class schedules into the calendar on this app, so, we have to keep cross-referencing my school/work schedule in order to align our study time with school and work.

**Story:**
As stressed college students, we want there to be a way to add our courses and work times so that our study plan can be created based around school and work.

**After:**
We added the ability to add our class/work schedule into our calendars on the study smart app itself so that the program can accurately generate a study plan that is based around our classes and work.

### Story 2 – Preventing Lost Data Between Sessions
**Before:**
I used to manually block out my class and work schedules on my regular phone calendar each week, constantly having to adjust or redo my study plan as new things came up or dropped off. It became confusing and easy to mix up multiple activities.


**Story:**
As a full-time college student who works best with a clear schedule planned ahead, I want to be able to input all my activities and upcoming events into one app that automatically adjusts around any changes, saving me time and eliminating scheduling confusion.


**After:**
With the ability to add my schedule to the calendar and have it automatically generate and adjust my study plan, I no longer have to spend time manually updating everything. It saves time, keeps my study schedule accurate, and removes the hassle of managing multiple apps.

### Story 3 – Managing Time-Sensitive Commitments
**Before:**
I sometimes accidentally scheduled study sessions at the same time as my work shifts or labs, causing stress and missed deadlines.

**Story:**
As a student balancing school and work, I want the app to prevent scheduling conflicts between classes, work, and study sessions so I can manage my time efficiently.

**After:**
Study Smart alerts me to any schedule conflicts when I add a class or work shift, ensuring my study plan fits without overlaps.

### Story 4 – Adaptive Schedule Updates
**Before:**
Whenever I had a class that got canceled or my work shift changed suddenly, my entire study plan would get thrown off. I would have to manually go back, rearrange everything, and often forget to reschedule certain study sessions or lower-priority deadlines.

**Story:**
As a busy student with a constantly changing schedule, I want something that not only adapts to my study plans and schedules, but also reallocates and optimizes whenever unforeseen changes occur in my schedules, that way no valuable study opportunities get lost nor will I have to waste time reorganizing and remembering everything.

**After:**
Now, when my schedule changes, Study Smart instantly updates my study plan to fit the new time entries, no more manual edits needed. It keeps my schedule realistic, flexible, and always up-to-date with my real life.
